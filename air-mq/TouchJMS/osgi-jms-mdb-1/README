There are two bundles:
a) a message producer - This is implemented as a pure OSGi bundle which looks up a topic and publishes a message.
b) a message consumer - This is implemented as an MDB.

How to use the sample:
------------------------

1. Download the sample from here and unzip it.

2. cd osgi-jms-mdb-1/

3. mvn clean install

4. Start GlassFish (something like "asadmin start-domain" or "java -jar glassfish.jar" will do)

5. Create a couple of JMS resources by executing the following commands (you can use the admingui if you prefer GUI)

asadmin create-jms-resource --restype javax.jms.Topic jms/osgi.Topic1

asadmin create-jms-resource --restype javax.jms.ConnectionFactory jms/osgi.ConnectionFactory1

6. copy the bundles and the config file to domain1/autodeploy/bundles/ directory. You can copy them in any order you like, but I suggest you copy them in the following order and keep a watch on domain1/logs/server.log (something like tail -f will do) to see the action.

cp ./message-consumer/target/osgijms1.consumer.jar $glassfish/domain1/autodeploy/bundles/

cp ./message-producer/target/osgijms1.producer.jar $glassfish/domain1/autodeploy/bundles/

cp ./osgijms1.producer.cfg $glassfish/domain1/autodeploy/bundles/
